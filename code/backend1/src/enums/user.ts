// backend1/src/enums/user.ts
// This file defines an enumeration for user-related constants, such as field names for first and last names.
// It is used to ensure consistency and avoid hardcoding strings in multiple places throughout the application.
// This file is part of the backend1/src/enums directory, which contains various enumerations
// used across the application to represent fixed sets of related constants. Enums help improve code readability
// and maintainability by providing meaningful names for constant values, making the code easier to understand and
// reducing the risk of errors caused by typos or incorrect string values. The user-related constants
// defined in this file are used in various parts of the application, including user management, authentication,
// and data processing, to ensure that user-related operations are performed consistently and correctly.
